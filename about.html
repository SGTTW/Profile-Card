            Who I Am
          </h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Oluwasegun Adeniyi, a passionate Frontend Developer with a
              love for creating accessible and user-friendly web experiences.
              I'm always eager to learn new technologies and best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              My background includes working with modern JavaScript frameworks,
              building RESTful APIs, and ensuring that every application I
              create is accessible to all users. I believe that the web should
              be inclusive, and I'm committed to making that a reality in every
              project I work on.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, playing guitar, or
              reading the latest tech blogs. I'm always looking for ways to
              improve my craft and contribute to the developer community.
            </p>

            My Goals in This Program
          </h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              I'm participating in this HNG program to deepen my
              expertise and become a more well-rounded developer. Here are my
              specific goals:
            </p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Master semantic HTML and accessibility:</strong> I want
                to ensure every project I build is accessible to users with
                disabilities and follows WCAG guidelines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals:</strong> While
                I'm comfortable with frameworks, I want to go deeper into
                vanilla JavaScript and understand how things work under the
                hood.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Build better testing habits:</strong> I want to
                incorporate automated testing into my workflow from the start,
                not as an afterthought.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improve my CSS skills:</strong> I want to create more
                sophisticated layouts and animations without relying solely on
                libraries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Contribute to open source:</strong> By the end of this
                program, I hope to have contributed to at least one open source
                project.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Confidence Section -->

            <span class="heading-icon">üí≠</span>
            Areas Where I Lack Confidence
          </h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Growth comes from acknowledging our weaknesses. Here are areas
              where I'm still building confidence:
            </p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Advanced CSS animations:</strong> While I can create
                basic transitions, complex keyframe animations and performance
                optimization still feel challenging.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Web performance optimization:</strong> I understand the
                basics, but diving into things like lazy loading, code
                splitting, and performance profiling feels overwhelming at
                times.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Accessibility testing:</strong> I know accessibility is
                important, but I'm not always sure if I'm testing thoroughly
                enough or using the right tools.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I can implement designs well,
                but creating them from scratch or making UX decisions without
                guidance makes me uncertain.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Browser compatibility issues:</strong> Debugging
                cross-browser issues, especially with older browsers, often
                stumps me.
              </li>

            <blockquote class="future-note">
              <p>
                Hey future me! Remember when all of this felt overwhelming? When
                you doubted whether you could truly master accessibility, write
                clean code, or build production-ready applications?
              </p>
              <p>
                Look at how far you've come. Every bug you debugged, every
                feature you built, every late night reading documentation ‚Äî it
                all added up. You're not the same developer you were at the
                start of this program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keep that beginner's mindset. Stay curious. Keep asking
                questions. And most importantly, remember that every expert was
                once a beginner. You're doing great. Keep going!

            Additional Thoughts
          </h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <h3>Why Frontend Development?</h3>
            <p>
              I chose frontend development because I love the immediate feedback
              loop. You write code, refresh the browser, and instantly see your
              creation come to life. There's something magical about turning a
              design mockup into a living, breathing interface that people
              interact with daily.
            </p>

            <h3>Learning Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
              I believe in learning by doing. Reading documentation is
              important, but nothing beats actually building projects and making
              mistakes. This program aligns perfectly with that philosophy ‚Äî
              each stage builds on the last, and the hands-on approach forces me
              to truly understand concepts rather than just memorizing them.
            </p>

            <h3>Gratitude</h3>
            <p>
              I'm grateful for this opportunity to learn alongside talented
              developers. The Frontend Wizards community has been incredibly
              supportive, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. To
              everyone who's helped me along the way. Thank you!
